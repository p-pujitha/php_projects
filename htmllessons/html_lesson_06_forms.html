<!--Forms in their various forms are the heart of taking data of all kinds from the end user. This presupposes that there
is a backend which accepts and processes the data in the forms.

Since we have not covered backend, we will just focus on display of common forms in this lesson and we will revisit them
in future units.

They will look ugly for now, but we will fix up the look and feel in the next unit.

Create a simple registration form as shown in image.
Don't worry about alignment and justification. we will do it in next unit.
